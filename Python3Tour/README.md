# Python3-Tour

Welcome to the workshop of data analysis in Python3.
This repository has few things:

- Introduction and Future Topics
- Basic Programming Environment
- Vacation Assignment
- A Python3 Tour

## Introduction

this workshop is meant to discuss the workflow and strategies
in data analysis of the biomedical field.
I will try my best to share my experience and explain as much
details and principles as possible.

Recently, interdisciplinary study is becoming more and more critical.
And computer science or programming is one of the general knowledge
that everyone who wants to do science should learn.
After this workshop, I hope that everyone could have a basic sense of
programming and be able to talk with experts more efficiently,
as well as do your analysis with this powerful tool.

### Future Topics
1. Numeric Data and Numpy
2. Tabular Data and Pandas
3. Statistics and Scipy
4. Visualization and Matplotlib
5. Machine Learning and Scikit-Learn

## Setup Your Computer!
For this workshop, we will use the `conda` to manage packages and environments.
Also, we will use `jupyter notebook` heavily with our codes and analysis.

Moreover, it is recommended that you could learn `git` (or version control) during
this vacation. It would be even better if you could create a Github account,
and make your codes open. And I can invite you into this `FDU-DataAnalysis-Workshop` repository if you like.

## Vacation Assignment
The very first [assignment](https://github.com/ZaneMuir/FDU-DataAnalysis-Workshop/tree/master/Assignment/Assignment%201) of this workshop is that:
```
1. collect some example data that you have met or will meet during your study or research.
2. classify and try to figure out the details of these data, using the "Assignment/Assignment 1/template.md" as the template.
```

to upload your assignment, you can make a pull request, or email me.

**Note**: `.md` is the extension of `markdown` file.
you can open it by any plain text editor like `atom`.

## A Python3 Tour
You can download and open the [`Python3Tour/A_Python3_Tour.ipynb`](https://github.com/ZaneMuir/FDU-DataAnalysis-Workshop/blob/master/Python3Tour/A%20Python3%20Tour.ipynb)
with `jupyter notebook`.

During this vacation, you should at least understand the concepts listed below:
- Basic Data Types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- Basic Data Collections: `list`, `tuple`, `dict`
- Basic Control Flow: `if-elif-else`, `for-in`, `while`
- Functions and Functional Programming: `def`, `lambda`
- Classes and Objects, and their difference: `class`
- Error Handling: `try ... except ...`

It is recommended that you can learn these extra contents listed below:
- some basic built-in modules: `sys`, `os`, `time`
- regular expression: `re`

#### Developing a Good Programming Style
Maintaining a program is much much harder than writing one. Therefore, a
good programming habit or style is very essential.

1. you should always name variables and functions with meaningful names so that
you don't have to write wordy comments after them.
2. comment necessary statements with precise words. The code should explain itself,
but when it is needed, you should append comments after them, telling why
you write your code that way.
3. keep everything simple.
4. write functions, not just scripts.
5. write functions with consistent argument ordering/style.
6. split a single file into multiple ones. Create your module would improve
the readability and make the maintenance easier.
7. Never overload built-in methods.

You can also check the _zen of Python_ by running the statement `import this`
in python.

## Finally
The best way to learn how to write code is to write code!

**NOTE**:
If you have any technical problem, open an [**issue**](https://github.com/ZaneMuir/FDU-DataAnalysis-Workshop/issues)
on this repository (so that everyone else who has a similar question can refer to this issue),
and I will response as soon as possible.

Good luck.
